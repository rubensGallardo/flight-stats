# flight-stats
Statistics calculated from flight records

**Usage**
This is a sbt project, so you can start sbt shell by running "sbt" and right after that:
- Run "compile" to compile the code
- Run "test" to run tests of the project - You will be able to see the result of test in the console
- Run "run" to run the prject, you will be able to see in the console the result of the exercises

**Comments**
The result of "run" should be added to the "src/main/result/${exerciseRunning}" but I struggled to store them locally, 
that's why they are being shown in the console. 
By the way I added the CSV files manually to the correct folder in order to be tested.
